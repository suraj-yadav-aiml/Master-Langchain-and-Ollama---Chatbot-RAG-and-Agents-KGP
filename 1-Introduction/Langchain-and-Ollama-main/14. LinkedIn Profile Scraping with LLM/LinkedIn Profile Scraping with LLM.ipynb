Audio Cleaning, Feature Extraction (more than 700 features) in Temporal, Spectral, Energy, Harmonic, and Cepstral domain, Feature Selection for faster training and better accuracy and ML models (CNN, LSTM, RF, SVM) are designed to classify snoring and other sound and their impact on sleep quality.A Real-Time System and Methods for the Detection of Sleep Apnea and Sleep StageUsed CNN, Inception, LSTM, CNN-LSTM models to estimate Sleep Apnea and Sleep Stages using the respiration signal only. The training data was obtained from MESA, National Sleep Research Resource, USA. I did data cleaning and balancing thereafter feature engineering and selection were done before applying the ML model. Achieved 82.7% accuracy in Sleep Apnea which is higher than any known methods applied on respiration signal in MESA Dataset and achieved more than 80% accuracy in sleep stage classification which can be considered as good accuracy.Visit:http://www.sleepdoc.aihttp://www.facebook.com/mBreathOfficialhttp://www.twitter.com/mBreathOfficialThere are some of the project which I did at mBreath.\\nReal-Time Human Vital Parameter Estimation Using Pressure Sensor and Machine Learning\\nMeasured respiration and heart rate through an array of pressure sensors and Deep Learning (CNN, RNN-LSTM) algorithms.

The information is used to convey Smart Assistance to the user for their daily improved health care conditions thus improving their efficiency and longevity. We are offering sleep disorder monitoring devices.

Owing to the large dynamic range and constant relative accuracy of floating point arithmetic, filters are traditionally realized in floating point data type. However, using floating point arithmetic in embedded systems lead to larger cost in terms of latency, power and memory. Therefore these algorithms need to be implemented in fixed point for optimizing these constraints. However with the reduction in the word length the precision get affected. Therefore these algorithms need to be coded properly with adequate fixed point format such that precision is not affected while the resources are optimized. In this thesis an attempt has been made to implement Least Mean Square (LMS), Recursive Least Square (RLS) and Kalman Filtering algorithms on ARM Cortex M0+ with Thumb instruction set. The word length has been optimized for accurate performance, reduced power, improved speed and reduced memory usage. The validation of the algorithm has been carried out with respect to MATLAB.\\nâ€¦see more\\nShow all 5 projects\\n',\n",

Successfully achieved kernel changes in Android OS to read data on Qualcommâ€™s Snapdragon processor using SPI, I2C, and UART. Interfaced Java and custom C-Language modules in Android 6.0. Designed an email marketing software for SleepDoc using AWS Boto3 Python, AWS SES, SNS, SQS, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and PyQt5.\n",
