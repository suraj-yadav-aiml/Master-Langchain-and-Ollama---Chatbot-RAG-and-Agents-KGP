This study investigated the actual consumption of fitness supple-\\nments utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Health Belief Model (HBM), and the Theory\\nof Effort Minimization in Physical Activity (TEMPA) frameworks. The TPB provided insights into\\nhow attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence individuals’ intentions\\nto consume fitness supplements. Additionally, the HBM sheds light on perceived effectiveness,\\nbenefits, barriers, and health motivation related to supplement consumption. Integrating the TEMPA\\nframework further investigated the role of effort minimization in physical activity contexts. Through\\nan online questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 250 fitness supplement-consuming\\nrespondents. SEM analysis revealed significant associations between behavioral intentions and\\nattitudes, perceived behavioral control, health motivation, and controlled precursors. However, it\\nwas seen that subjective norms, perceived effectiveness, perceived benefits, and automatic precursors\\nwere deemed insignificant. The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the factors\\nshaping actual consumption behaviors, offering valuable implications for marketers, health profes-\\nsionals, and policymakers seeking to promote informed and responsible supplement use among\\nhealth and fitness enthusiasts.\\nKeywords: fitness supplements; health belief model; theory of effort of minimization; theory of\\nplanned behavior; structural equation modelling\\n1. Introduction\\nSupplementary drinks or fitness supplements are commonly used to enhance an\\nindividual’s performance in various sports and health settings, catering to both competitive\\nand non-competitive athletes [1]. One widely known supplement for athletes and fitness\\nenthusiasts is protein supplements like protein shakes. Others may be whey protein,\\ncaffeine, and creatine, to name a few. These supplements play a crucial role in helping\\nindividuals increase muscle mass, recover faster, and enhance their overall performance [2].\\nWhey protein stands out as a top-quality protein source, containing more essential amino\\nacids than traditional protein sources. Its numerous benefits have made it a popular choice\\nfor snacks and drinks among consumers [3]. Another widely embraced supplement is\\ncaffeine, which is found in many sports and food supplements. Caffeine reduces perceived\\neffort, minimizes fatigue and pain, and proves to be effective for endurance and high-\\nintensity activities, which is the choice of consumers [4].\\nCreatine monohydrate is another well-known supplement used to gain muscle mass\\nand support performance and recovery. It is known not to increase fat mass and remains\\neffective even when taken in recommended doses [5]. Despite its popularity in the fitness\\nFoods 2024, 13, 1424. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods13091424\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\\n')"

      "1. **Eat a healthy and balanced diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n",
      "2. **Keep track of your calorie intake**: Use a food diary or an app to track your daily calorie consumption. Aim for a deficit of 500-1000 calories per day to promote weight loss.\n",
      "3. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help control hunger and boost metabolism.\n",
      "4. **Exercise regularly**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week. You can also incorporate strength training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into your routine.\n",
      "5. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help regulate hunger hormones and support weight loss.\n",
      "6. **Be mindful of portion sizes**: Use a food scale or measuring cups to measure out your food portions, and eat slowly and mindfully to avoid overeating.\n",
      "7. **Find healthy ways to cope with stress**: Chronic stress can lead to overeating and weight gain. Try stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n",
      "8. **Get enough physical activity outside of exercise**: Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk or bike to work, or do household chores to increase your overall physical activity levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, losing weight is not just about following a specific diet or exercise plan - it's also about making sustainable lifestyle changes that you can maintain in the long term. Consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to create a personalized weight loss plan that suits your needs and goals!\n"

      "This article discusses the potential therapeutic and toxic mechanisms of action of botanical supplements, also known as herbal remedies. The authors review various botanicals, their primary active constituents, typical use, dosage, and reported adverse effects. They note that concurrent exposure to other compounds and the heterogeneity of herbal supplements can make it difficult to determine the specific mechanism of toxicity. Case reports have identified potential mechanisms for liver toxicity in some botanicals, such as black cohosh, kava kava, saw palmetto, and milk thistle. Other botanicals, such as yohimbe and ginkgo biloba, have been associated with non-hepatic symptoms like seizures and bleeding. The article also discusses potential herb-drug interactions, where the activation of metabolizing enzymes can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs.\n",

      "Some key points from the article include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Botanical supplements can have therapeutic and toxic mechanisms of action.\n",
      "* Many botanicals have not been thoroughly studied for their safety and efficacy.\n",
      "* Adverse effects are often mild but can be serious in some cases, such as liver failure and bleeding.\n",
      "* Herb-drug interactions can occur due to the activation of metabolizing enzymes.\n",
      "* The pregnane-X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) are common mechanisms among several botanicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the article highlights the need for further research on the safety and efficacy of botanical supplements and their potential interactions with other medications.\n"
